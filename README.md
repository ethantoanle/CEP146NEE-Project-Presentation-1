## Topic summary - Ethan

In the article titled “Programming Language Trends in 2025: What Developers Are Using Now”, Alex Carter (2025) reveals that Python is poised to dominate the programming landscape in 2025, with AI-driven growth and a market share of 25.98%. Meanwhile, JavaScript remains a staple for web development but faces competition from TypeScript, which is favored for scalable projects. Rust and Go are gaining popularity, excelling in cloud-native and high-performance applications. Meanwhile, older languages like PHP and C# are seeing a significant decline.

**Key Insights:**
- Python: Leading in AI/ML focus; surpassing JavaScript on GitHub with 22.5% growth in contributions.
- Rust: Clim ranking with 72% developer approval for security and memory efficiency.
- Go: Popular for cloud-native systems; rising to #7 in the TIOBE Index.
- TypeScript: Used by 69% of developers for large-scale web applications.
- JavaScript: Powers 98% of websites but falls to #6 in the IEEE Spectrum rankings.
- C# and PHP: Usage declines due to competition and modern alternatives.

## Dominant Languages - Ethan
Based on IEEE Spectrum's ranked metrics which include job demand, GitHub activity, search queries and StackExchange mentions [(IEEE Spectrum, 2025)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2025). The rank reveals that
- Python holds the top spot in the “Spectrum” ranking (IEEE’s default) and also leads in the “Jobs” ranking (i.e. what employer demand shows).
- SQL remains a key skill in job demand (ranking high in the “Jobs” metric).
- JavaScript—traditionally a powerhouse especially for web programming.

## Growing Languages - Ihab
**Microsoft acquisition news or GitHub updates**

In June 2018 Microsoft acquired github for 7.5 billion. Since then, GitHub has continued to operate independently but with more resources and tighter integration with Microsoft’s ecosystem. After the acquisition, GitHub introduced several major features. These include GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant developed with OpenAI, GitHub Actions for automating development workflows, GitHub Codespaces for cloud-based coding, and Dependabot, which automatically detects and fixes security issues in project dependencies. Microsoft also integrated GitHub more deeply into tools like Visual Studio and Azure, helping developers streamline their coding and deployment processes. The platform has seen strong growth in both users and repositories. Although there were concerns in the developer community about the acquisition, GitHub has maintained its support for open-source development and remains a key platform for millions of developers worldwide.

## Key Trends - Lance

### [Top 5 Language Language You Need to learn]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj0RwiiKiRU&t=1s )
- For the upcoming AI trend Phyton is suprassing most if not all programming languanges since very easy to learn, and great for AI, data science and automation.
- Java Script is popular specially for web-development since it upgrades the websites tremendously from design to interactive pages and more.
- C and C++ is a more tech language than listed since it teaches more than just coding but also how computer works to be able to gain more performance or speed.
- Go (Go Lang) is like Phyton, JavaScript, and C combined. It is fast, simple and efficient programming language build by Google for creating reliable, scalable software-- especially for server and cloud systems.

## Final question
- Each group must end their video with one thought-provoking test question related to their topic.
- Each student (individually) must comment or answer questions posed by other groups.

# Deliverables Checklist
All items must be committed to the group’s GitHub repository:
- Research notes or draft write-up
- Video script or outline
- Visual slides (if used)
- Final video YouTube link
- Final question for audience engagement
- Evidence of collaboration (issues, commits, pull requests, etc.)

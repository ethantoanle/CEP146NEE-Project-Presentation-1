## Topic summary

In the article titled “Programming Language Trends in 2025: What Developers Are Using Now”, Alex Carter (2025) reveals that Python is poised to dominate the programming landscape in 2025, with AI-driven growth and a market share of 25.98%. Meanwhile, JavaScript remains a staple for web development but faces competition from TypeScript, which is favored for scalable projects. Rust and Go are gaining popularity, excelling in cloud-native and high-performance applications. Meanwhile, older languages like PHP and C# are seeing a significant decline.

**Key Insights:**
- Python: Leading in AI/ML focus; surpassing JavaScript on GitHub with 20.5% growth in contributions.
- Rust: Clim ranking with 67% developer approval for security and memory efficiency.
- Go: Popular for cloud-native systems; rising to #7 in the TIOBE Index.
- TypeScript: Used by 69% of developers for large-scale web applications.
- JavaScript: Powers 98% of websites but falls to #6 in the IEEE Spectrum rankings.
- C# and PHP: Usage declines due to competition and modern alternatives.

### Dominant Languages
### Growing Languages
### Other Notable Languages

1. RUST
- System programming
- OS, secure apps
- Focus on memory safety without garbage collection

2. Swift
- Compiled, by Apple
- iOS, macOS apps
- Safe, fast, beginner-friendly

3. PHP
- Server-side scripting
- Websites, WordPress
- Powers 70%+ of websites

4. C# (C-Sharp)
- Object-oriented, by Microsoft
- Game dev (Unity), Windows apps
- Combines C++ power with Java simplicity


### Key Trends

### Top 5 Language Language You Need to learn ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj0RwiiKiRU&t=1s )
- For the upcoming AI trend Phyton is suprassing most if not all programming languanges since very easy to learn, and great for AI, data science and automation.
- Java Script is popular specially for web-development since it upgrades the websites tremendously from design to interactive pages and more.
- C and C++ is a more tech language than listed since it teaches more than just coding but also how computer works to be able to gain more performance or speed.
- Go (Go Lang) is like Phyton, JavaScript, and C combined. It is fast, simple and efficient programming language build by Google for creating reliable, scalable software-- especially for server and cloud systems.

## Final question
- Each group must end their video with one thought-provoking test question related to their topic.
- Each student (individually) must comment or answer questions posed by other groups.

# Deliverables Checklist
All items must be committed to the group’s GitHub repository:
- Research notes or draft write-up
- Video script or outline
- Visual slides (if used)
- Final video YouTube link
- Final question for audience engagement
- Evidence of collaboration (issues, commits, pull requests, etc.)

**Slide 1:** Dear Prof. Wong and Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to our presentation on Programming Language Trends.
We are Group 3 — Ethan, Ihab, Komil, Lance. Today, we’ll explore how programming languages have evolved, which ones are dominating the field, and what future trends we should pay attention to.
**Slide 2:**
We’ll briefly cover five parts:
•	Introduction
•	Dominant and growing languages
•	Other major languages
•	Key trends
•	Conclusion and questions
**Slide 3:**
•	Python currently leads because it’s easy to learn and widely used in AI, data science, and automation.
•	SQL remains essential for working with databases, while JavaScript continues to dominate web development and front-end design.
•	Together, these three form the backbone of most modern software projects.
**Slide 4:**
Operates independently with Microsoft support
Key features added: Copilot, Actions, Codespaces, Dependabot
Integrated with Visual Studio & Azure
Results: growth in users, stronger ecosystem, open-source focus maintained
**Slide 5:**
Rust – System programming, OS & secure apps; memory-safe without garbage collection
Swift – Apple ecosystem (iOS/macOS); compiled, safe, fast, beginner-friendly
PHP – Server-side web scripting; powers 70%+ of websites, including WordPress
C# – Microsoft, object-oriented; Windows apps & Unity game development; C++ power + Java simplicity
**Slide 6:**
Trends in the AI Era
Python – Leading language for AI, data science, and automation; easy to learn and widely adopted.
JavaScript – Key for modern web development; enhances design, interactivity, and user experience.
C / C++ – Teaches low-level computing concepts; essential for performance-critical applications.
Go (Golang) – Built by Google; combines Python’s simplicity, C’s speed, and JavaScript’s scalability—ideal for cloud and server systems.
**Slide 7:**
To conclude, programming languages evolve with technology. Python is a leader today, but new tools and trends may change that in the near future.
We’d like to ask: How do you think the trends will change in both academia and industry over the next five years? Can a single language like Python maintain its dominance in the long term, or will specialized languages eventually break it?
Thank you for listening!
